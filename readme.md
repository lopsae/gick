Simple scripts and tools for git.


To use the executable files found here either add the project location into your PATH enviroment variable, or use directly the scripts wherever they are.

Some scripts may use the aliases defined in the .galiases file. This must be sourced into your current shell session.

Some of the scripts depend on the enviroment variable GOOLS_DIFFTOOL
which is used as the --tool option for "git mergetool" and "git difftool".
